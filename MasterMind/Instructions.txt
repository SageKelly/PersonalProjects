The objective of the game is to figure out the code that the computer has randomly created.

When you first reach the game screen, it will show the available symbols you can use to 
figure out the computer's code. Type in a combination of symbols of length 4 and press 
"Enter". It will then appear on the screen in the first available slot.

The computer will then let you know how close your were to its code by using the last four 
slots on the screen and placing either 0, 1, or 2 in the slots. "0" means that that on of 
the symbols are wrong, "1" means that one of the symbols is right, but in the wrong slot, 
and "2" means that one of the symbols is right AND in the right slot. They are placed 
randomly, so there is no correspondence between your code and the placement numbers (i.e.
if the first slot is "0", that does not that the first symbol you put in was wrong).

For example, I may have put in the code "!@#$" and got this in return:

    - - - -   - - - -
1. |!|@|#|$| |0|1|2|0| <---Here, it's saying that two are wrong (the zeros), one is right,
    - - - -   - - - -      but not in the right place (the one), and one is both right AND
2. | | | | | | | | | |     in the right place (the two).
    - - - -   - - - - 

You have ten turns to figure it out. If you figure out before then, or one the tenth turn,
you win. However, if you can't you lose, at which point, you will be sent to a screen that
will tell you what the computer's code was. Afterwards, you can then choose whether or not
you want to play again. The game will start over, and you will have to choose your name and
your piece amount again.
